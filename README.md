<h1> Mix It Project </h1>
<p> Mix It is a project built for Dicoding Front End Web Development Bootcamp. It is built using HTML with custom elements (similiar to Web Components), vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It is developed using Webpack environment and deployed into the browser as a bundled module using Webpack. The project itself is compatible with older browser as it uses Babel to convert JavaScript ES6 to more widely adopted JavaScript ES5 syntax. The project itself consists of two features: search cocktail by ingredient and display cocktail mixing instructions.</p>
<h2>Search Cocktail by Ingredient</h2>
<p>This feature is built using an AJAX request to TheCocktailDB API. The response is then displayed in a grid-style catalog and users can chose which cocktail they want to make.</p>
<h2>Display Instructions</h2>
<p>Another feature built using an AJAX request to TheCocktailDB API. When users has chosen the cocktail that they want to make and click the button in said cocktail, a popup will display the ingredients needed to make said cocktail and shows how to make the cocktail</p>
